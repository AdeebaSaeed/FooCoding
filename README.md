## Full Stack Development
Welcome to My GitHub repository! Here, you'll find a collection of educational projects and assignments completed during an intensive 6-month bootcamp focused on Full Stack Development. Our journey was guided by a team of professional developers equipped with the latest technologies and industry insights. Throughout this immersive experience, we delved into the realms of React, JavaScript, TypeScript, MySQL, Git, GitHub, and RESTful API development. Join us on this educational adventure, and explore the fruits of our hard work and dedication.

This repository contains a comprehensive overview of key topics covered in our learning journey:
HTML5/CSS3 and Command Line Interface (CLI) Fundamentals
JavaScript, GIT Version Control, and the Art of Debugging
Exploring Node.js and Express for Backend Development
Mastering Database Management with MySQL and Command Line Interface (CLI)
Immersive Dive into the World of React
Before achieving course completion, we were tasked with an enriching final project, mirroring a real-world experience within a typical software company. I invite you to explore my Final project
